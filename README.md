# Hi there üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I am a fullstack web developer focusing mainly on backend development. Most of my professional experience has been in PHP, although I use .NET for hobby and university projects. Most my front-end knowledge comes from prior front-end development jobs or hometaught experience.
